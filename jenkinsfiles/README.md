# Jenkins Job-DSL and Pipeline Code
This directory contains Jenkins Job-DSL scripts and Jenkinsfile pipelines that are used to configure Jenkins jobs (AKA Projects) entirely through code.

To access the Job-DSL API, you can go to http://localhost:8080/plugin/job-dsl/api-viewer/index.html. This API viewer shows only the components available for this Jenkins instance.
